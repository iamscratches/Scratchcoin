# Scratchcoin 
*(A blockchain implementation similar to Bitcoin running on NodeJs)*

**Brief Description:**
This is a blockchain-based online cryptocurrency system that is loosely based on the technology used in Bitcoins and is very fast and mining can be done and a lot more exciting features like checking wallet balance etc. along with usual crypto tasks such as transaction, maintaining mempool etc., while still working in full anonymity and adjusting difficulty at each mining point for hash mining. It's a real fun project to explore and really easy to compile and run. Check it out if u want to have some fun with the concepts of blockchain

In order to run this project you just need to clone the project and install all the dependencies using `npm install` and u r good to go :blush:

***Features:***
 - *jest for testing project breakdowns* - It is a really very useful tool used by many large scale project developers in order to ensure a safety valve that the project doesn't break or throws error on certain crucial
 part of the algorithm so that developers won't have to spend hours searching for minute bugs
 - *looking at the package.json file(peer nodes for testing the working of the project)* - one can just look at the scripts part of package.json and run the scripts to see the project in action. No need to go through the entire code to understand and run it. Be a trail and error person.
 - *Project in action* - Take a look at the project in action with two different peer nodes coordinating with each other on the same network
 - *Transact with ur buddies over the network* - You can transact with ur buddies over the network with full anonimity, u can use their public address and also save the addresses with nicknames on ur wallet for faster and easier frequent transaction
 - *Get the transaction public address of a certain peer-node in the network* - 
 - *look at the list of all pending/unconfirmed transactions in the mempool* - 
 - *look at individual peer node wallet balance* - 
 - *U can mine transaction and get credited rewards for mining such transaction in the mentioned peer-node* - 
 - *Save frequent users* - u can save public address info of others in ur wallet with ur given nicknames to make transaction with frequent users easier and faster as their is no more need to remember huge 64 char long public addresses of each peers for transaction.
 - *look at real-time mining and acceptance results, chain formation at each nodes* - 
 - *Get a look at ur updated wallet balance after unconfirmed transaction gets mined* -
